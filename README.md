# MakanMatch Backend

**MakanMatch is a food-sharing platform deployed by theoretically by the People's Association in Singapore to help reduce food wastage and to foster a sense of community among residents.**

Hosts can invite fellow guests in their neighbourhood for a meal at their place through this platform, resulting in numerous overall benefits:
- Reducing food wastage
- Fostering a sense of community
- Guests get to have homemade food
- Guests can have food at cheaper prices with fellow neighbours rather than eating out

The increasing food wastage in Singapore and worldwide has raised several environmental concerns; we want to combat the pressing issue effectively through this communal, comprehensive and easy-to-use solution.

MakanMatch is an ambitious project envisioned and developed by the MakanMatch Team for the Full Stack Development Project module in Year 2 Semester 1 of the Diploma in Information Technology course at Nanyang Polytechnic.

The system (hopefully üòì) should be live at https://makanmatch.com
